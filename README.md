# Qilin Watermelon Dataset

## Introduction
The Qilin Watermelon Dataset is a unique collection of data that explores the relationship between a watermelon's appearance, tapping sound, and sweetness. This dataset aims to facilitate research and analysis in the field of non-destructive quality assessment of watermelons.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of two main components:
1. **wav files**: Audio recordings of the tapping sounds produced when striking the watermelons with varying degrees of force. These recordings capture the acoustic properties of the watermelons, which may provide insights into their internal structure and ripeness.
2. **jpg files**: Images showcasing the external appearance of each watermelon, including visual characteristics such as color, texture, and shape.

In addition to the audio and visual data, the dataset also includes sweetness measurements obtained using a sugar meter. These measurements provide a quantitative value that can be correlated with the tapping sounds and visual appearance of the watermelons.
